# minotaur-chess-ai
This is an AI for playing chess that I am developing. It utilizes a neural network to evaluate the board and determine the next move. This AI does not use a search function to look multiple moves ahead. I'm interested to see how powerful I can make this bot without ever calculating ahead.
